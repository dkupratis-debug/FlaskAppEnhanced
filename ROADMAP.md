# Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the project useful as both a Flask scaffold and a GitHub learning repo.

## Now (Current Focus)

- Keep beginner docs clear and accurate
- Maintain CI / Release / GHCR package workflows
- Improve visual learning materials (screenshots/GIFs)
- Keep workshop issues beginner-friendly
- Review and merge dependency/security updates safely

## Next (High Impact)

- Add real screenshots to `docs/images/`
- Add a live demo deployment and set `About -> Website`
- Add a short walkthrough video link in `README.md`
- Enable GitHub Discussions for beginner questions
- Add more workshop issues (docs, tests, workflow-reading)

## Later (Professional Polish)

- Add `docs/FAQ.md` for repeated beginner questions
- Add a GitHub Pages docs site for `docs/`
- Add a "broken branch" practice exercise for debugging + PR review
- Add a deployment workflow for a demo environment
- Add a lightweight architecture diagram image export

## Maintenance Routine (Owner)

Weekly:
- Check `Insights -> Traffic`
- Check `Issues` / `Pull requests`
- Check `Actions`
- Review Dependabot PRs/alerts

Monthly:
- Review collaborator access
- Refresh beginner docs if learners get stuck on the same step
- Add or rotate a workshop exercise

## Release Discipline

- `PATCH` for docs/bug fixes (`v0.2.4`)
- `MINOR` for new features/learning content (`v0.3.0`)
- `MAJOR` for breaking changes (`v1.0.0`)

See `docs/VERSIONING_AND_RELEASES.md` for the full release flow.
