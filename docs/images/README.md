# Images and GIFs (Placeholders + Capture Plan)

Use this folder for screenshots and short GIFs that make the GitHub learning walkthrough more visual.

## Recommended Files to Add

### GitHub UI screenshots
- `github-code-tab.png`
- `github-pr-conversation.png`
- `github-pr-files-changed.png`
- `github-actions-run-success.png`
- `github-release-page.png`
- `github-package-page.png`

### Optional GIFs (short, 5-15 seconds)

## Capture Tips
- Hide bookmarks and unrelated tabs
- Blur personal notifications if needed
- Use consistent browser zoom (100%)
- Prefer PNG for screenshots, GIF or MP4 for short demos
- Keep images under ~1-2 MB when possible

## Exact Capture Checklist
- Use `docs/images/CAPTURE_CHECKLIST.md` for a step-by-step click/capture plan
- Use the recommended filenames there so README/docs links stay consistent

## Safe Sharing Tip
Before capturing GitHub screens for public sharing:
- confirm no secrets/tokens are visible
- confirm no private repo names you don't want shared are visible
- crop out profile menus if needed
