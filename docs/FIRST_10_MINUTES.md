# First 10 Minutes

Use this if you are brand new to GitHub or coding projects.

## Goal

In 10 minutes, you will:
- understand what this repo is
- find the beginner docs
- see where practice tasks live
- see where updates/checks happen

## What You Need

- A web browser
- A GitHub account (optional if you are only looking)

## Step-by-Step (Clicks + Expected Result)

1. Open the repository homepage:
   - `https://github.com/dkupratis-debug/FlaskAppEnhanced`
   - Expected result: you can see the repo name and top tabs.
1. Look at the top tabs:
   - `Code`
   - `Issues`
   - `Pull requests`
   - `Actions`
   - `Releases`
   - Expected result: you understand where each workflow lives.
1. Open the interactive dashboard route:
   - append `/learn` to the app URL when running locally (for example `http://127.0.0.1:5000/learn`)
   - Expected result: you see track selection, checklist, and quick links.
1. Scroll the main page and read the top of `README.md`.
   - Expected result: you know what the project is and what it teaches.
1. In the README, open:
   - `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md`
   - `docs/SAFE_SHARING.md` (if you want to share or post it)
   - Expected result: you can explain the main GitHub tabs and safe sharing basics.
1. Click the `Issues` tab.
1. Open the pinned issue:
   - `#9 Start Here: Learn GitHub + Flask using this repo`
   - Expected result: you can see the guided learning order.
1. Pick one workshop issue:
   - `#4` tiny README improvement
   - `#5` inspect workflows
   - `#6` practice PR review
   - `#7` deploy a demo
   - Expected result: you have one concrete task to do next.
1. Click the `Actions` tab and open a green run.
   - Expected result: you can see automated checks and logs.
1. Click the `Releases` section and open the latest release.
   - Expected result: you can see release notes and versioned assets.
1. Optional: click `Packages` to see the GHCR container package workflow result.
   - Expected result: you understand Releases vs Packages.

## If You Want to Practice Safely

1. Click `Fork` (top-right).
2. Make a tiny change in your own copy.
3. Open a Pull Request in your fork.
4. Watch `Actions` run checks.

You cannot break the original project by doing this in your own fork.

## What Each Tab Means (Quick)

- `Code` = files and README
- `Issues` = tasks/questions
- `Pull requests` = proposed changes
- `Actions` = automated checks
- `Releases` = published versions

## Next Step After 10 Minutes

- Read `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md` for a deeper walkthrough
- Try issue `#4` for your first hands-on task
- Use `docs/PRACTICE_EXAMPLES.md` for more guided exercises

## Common Beginner Questions

### "Can I break your repo by clicking around?"
No. Viewing and forking are safe. You cannot push to the main repo without permission.

### "Where should I start if I have zero experience?"
Start with issue `#4` and only do one tiny README sentence update.

### "Where do I see if my work is correct?"
In `Actions`, open your workflow run and check if all jobs are green.
