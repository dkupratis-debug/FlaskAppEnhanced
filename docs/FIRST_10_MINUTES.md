# First 10 Minutes

Use this if you are brand new to GitHub or coding projects.

## Goal

In 10 minutes, you will:
- understand what this repo is
- find the beginner docs
- see where practice tasks live
- see where updates/checks happen

## What You Need

- A web browser
- A GitHub account (optional if you are only looking)

## Step-by-Step (Clicks)

1. Open the repository homepage.
2. Look at the top tabs:
   - `Code`
   - `Issues`
   - `Pull requests`
   - `Actions`
   - `Releases`
3. Scroll the main page and read the top of `README.md`.
4. In the README, open:
   - `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md`
   - `docs/SAFE_SHARING.md` (if you want to share or post it)
5. Click the `Issues` tab.
6. Open the pinned issue:
   - `#9 Start Here: Learn GitHub + Flask using this repo`
7. Pick one workshop issue:
   - `#4` tiny README improvement
   - `#5` inspect workflows
   - `#6` practice PR review
   - `#7` deploy a demo
8. Click the `Actions` tab and open a green run.
9. Click the `Releases` section and open the latest release.
10. Optional: click `Packages` to see the GHCR container package workflow result.

## If You Want to Practice Safely

1. Click `Fork` (top-right).
2. Make a tiny change in your own copy.
3. Open a Pull Request in your fork.
4. Watch `Actions` run checks.

You cannot break the original project by doing this in your own fork.

## What Each Tab Means (Quick)

- `Code` = files and README
- `Issues` = tasks/questions
- `Pull requests` = proposed changes
- `Actions` = automated checks
- `Releases` = published versions

## Next Step After 10 Minutes

- Read `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md` for a deeper walkthrough
- Try issue `#4` for your first hands-on task
