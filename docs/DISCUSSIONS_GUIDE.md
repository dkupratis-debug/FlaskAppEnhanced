# Discussions Guide

Use GitHub Discussions for learner questions, ideas, and progress updates.

## Start Here

- Start Here discussion: `https://github.com/dkupratis-debug/FlaskAppEnhanced/discussions/29`
- Beginner click guide: `docs/FIRST_10_MINUTES.md`
- Main walkthrough: `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md`

## Which Category to Use

- `Q&A`: beginner questions, setup problems, workflow confusion
- `Ideas`: improvements to docs, training tasks, repo structure
- `Show and tell`: share learner progress, screenshots, or completed exercises
- `Announcements`: maintainer updates and major training changes
- `General`: anything that does not fit the categories above

## Maintainer Moderation Flow

1. Check new posts daily.
1. Answer `Q&A` posts with direct steps and file links.
1. Convert actionable ideas into Issues.
1. Close the loop by linking resolved PRs back into the discussion thread.
1. Remove secrets, tokens, or sensitive information immediately if posted.

## Safety Rules for Public Learning

- Never post `.env` values, API keys, or access tokens.
- Keep all contributions through Pull Requests with CI checks.
- Keep branch protection enabled on `main`.
- Use `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reports instead of public discussion threads.
