## Copy/Paste Post Template (Professional + Beginner Friendly)

I created a beginner-friendly GitHub learning repository that shows how a real software project is organized, reviewed, tested, and published.

It includes:
- a small Flask web app
- step-by-step guides
- practice exercises for beginners
- real CI/release/package workflows

Repository:
[FlaskAppEnhanced](https://github.com/dkupratis-debug/FlaskAppEnhanced)

Start here:
1. Read the README
2. Open `docs/FIRST_10_MINUTES.md`
3. Open the pinned "Start Here" issue (#9)
4. Pick one task from `docs/PRACTICE_EXAMPLES.md`

Safe to explore:
- Viewing is safe
- Forking is safe
- You cannot change the main repo unless you are granted permission

## Follow-up Comment Template

If you are new, start with one tiny task:
1. Fork the repo
2. Change one README line
3. Open a PR in your fork
4. Watch the Actions checks run

## Common Questions You May Get

### "Can I break your repo?"
No. People can read/fork, but cannot push to your main repo without access.

### "I do not know coding, can I still learn?"
Yes. Start with `docs/FIRST_10_MINUTES.md` and the GitHub tab walkthrough.

### "Where do I ask for help?"
Open an issue and explain what step you are on and what error you saw.
