# Coaching Reply Templates

Use these templates to help learners quickly and consistently.

## Template: First-Time Welcome

Thanks for joining. Start here:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/FIRST_10_MINUTES.md`
3. pinned issue `#9`
4. Exercise 1 in `docs/PRACTICE_EXAMPLES.md`

If you share what step you are on, I can guide you faster.

## Template: Need More Details

Thanks for reporting this. Please add:
1. exact command you ran
2. full error output
3. OS + Python version
4. screenshot (if UI-related)

With this, I can give you an exact fix.

## Template: PR Feedback (Constructive)

Good progress. Before merge, please address:
1. [specific file/path]
2. [specific behavior/check]
3. [specific test/doc update]

After updates, re-run checks and post back here.

## Template: Check Failed

This is usually a CI check issue, not a full failure.
Please open `Actions`, then:
1. click the failed run
2. open the failed job
3. copy the final error block

Share that here and I will map it to a fix.

## Template: Security Concern

Thanks for raising this. Do not post sensitive details publicly.
Please use `SECURITY.md` reporting flow for potential vulnerabilities.

## Template: Completion Congratulations

Great work. You finished this task.
Suggested next step:
1. next exercise in `docs/PRACTICE_EXAMPLES.md`
2. open/review one PR
3. inspect one workflow in `Actions`
