# Engagement Playbook

Use this to keep the repository active, useful, and beginner-friendly every week.

## Weekly Routine (30-45 minutes)

1. Post one prompt in Discussions:
   - use `docs/templates/WEEKLY_DISCUSSION_PROMPT.md`
2. Answer at least 3 learner questions in Q&A.
3. Review open PRs and link any common CI failures to `docs/CI_TROUBLESHOOTING_FLOW.md`.
4. Share one learner success in `Show and tell`.
5. Check and update pinned onboarding post if links changed.

## Monthly Routine (45-60 minutes)

1. Publish recap using `docs/templates/MONTHLY_RECAP_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Summarize:
   - top issues learners hit
   - what was improved
   - next month focus topic
3. Refresh one practice scenario in `docs/BROKEN_TO_FIXED_SCENARIOS.md`.
4. Validate docs links and screenshots still match current UI.
