Use the right channel so questions and problems are easier to handle.

## Where to Ask for Help

### Usage Questions / Learning Help
- Open a GitHub Issue if your question is specific to this repository.
- Include:
  - what you tried
  - exact command(s)
  - error output
  - your environment (OS, Python version)

### Bug Reports
- Use the bug report issue template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

### Security Issues
- Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities.
- Use the repository Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`) and GitHub's security reporting flow when possible.

## Before Opening an Issue
- Read `README.md`
- Read `docs/GITHUB_GUIDE.md`
- Run tests locally (`pytest`)
- Check recent Actions runs for failures

## Response Expectations
This is a learning/demo repository. Responses may be best-effort and may not be immediate, but clear reproduction details make help much faster.

## Target Service Levels (Best Effort)

- New learner help request triage: within 48 hours
- Bug report triage: within 72 hours
- Security report acknowledgement: within 24 hours

These are targets, not guaranteed SLAs. Public holidays and maintainer availability can affect timing.
